# MaRecipe with Bootstrap

[Preview Static Page](https://michaelhtran120.github.io/MaRecipe-Bootstrap/)

## Overview

This static webpage was built for Nucamp's fullstack portfolio project during the Bootstrap course section. The goal is to utilize Bootstrap to quickly build a webpage. (Utlize the Bootstrap CDN instead of NPM install)

The project idea stem from my focus on diet and interest in cooking, but its difficult to constantly having to calculate the macros involved in everything I cook.

This is only a static page to show what I will eventually build into a single page web application using React and hopefully an application with React Native.

I have had previous experience working with CSS prior to learning Bootstrap so I felt at ease utilize Bootstrap to quickly design my webpage layout and using custom CSS to override Bootstrap when needed to fit my design vision. I did want a bit more complexity to the web page so I played around with CSS animations that hopefully adds a bit more modern feel to the static webpage. Overall there were slight issues with responsiveness that took time to troubleshoot, but it was a good learning experience. Although I am still having issues with the parallax video working on mobile browser.

## Some CSS features

- Custom hover Effects for buttons
- Progress bar showing how much page content is loaded. (A green line right below the navigatio bar)
- Animations of content fading in and sliding into the page using CDN and custom CSS/Javascript.
- Parallax video (located in the hero section of the home page) (issue on mobile browser and hoping to resolve)
- Animations of navigation bar links

I discovered a few CDN's that help with lazy loading, animations, and a progress bar when loading the document that helps with the user experience.

1. Lozad for lazy loading content/images
2. Animate.css for some animation assistance
3. Pace.js for progress bar for visual display of content loading.

## Forms

As of now the forms do not function as there is no backend tied to this project, but I did add javascript to provide some input verification in the sign up modal.

## Additional Notes

As of October 14 2021:

The wireframes shown throughout the static pages are rough ideas of what I imagine the application to appear and do not show the actual representation. I aim to replace these images once the native application has been developed.
